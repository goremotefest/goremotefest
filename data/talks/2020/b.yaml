title: "Maps in detail"
talk: "Go programmers use maps day in and day out without a lot of fanfare. Like most well designed things, maps just work, and so most of us general don't give a second thought. But have you ever sat down and wondered +how+ maps actually work in Go? How does one type, written in Go, work for almost any key and value +without+ generics?
        <br/><br/>
       In this talk you'll learn about the design decisions that lead to Go's map implementation, we'll compare and contrast Go's maps to implementations in languages like Java and C++, and learn how the runtime implements a generic map type +without+ generics."
