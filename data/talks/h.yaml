title: "Let's build event-driven application in 15 minutes"
talk: "Building event-driven applications should be as easy as building HTTP API - this was our goal when we were starting to work on Watermill.<br/><br/>
       During the talk, I would like to tell you the story of how we created one of the most popular libraries for building event-driven applications in Go. I will not end with the theory - I will do a quick live coding to show you how to use Watermill. The application will be independent of any Pub/Sub implementation and will be able to work with RabbitMQ, Kafka or even MySQL without many changes."
